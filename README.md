# Solo TTRPG Notation

A plugin for recording and tracking solo tabletop RPG sessions using a standardized notation system.

## What is Solo TTRPG Notation?

Solo TTRPG Notation is a lightweight text-based system for documenting your solo TTRPG sessions. It lets you:

- Record actions, oracle questions, and dice rolls in a consistent format
- Tag NPCs, locations, and story threads as they appear
- Track progress with clocks, tracks, and timers
- Review your campaign history with powerful browsing tools

All notation lives in code blocks within your markdown files, keeping your narrative text clean and readable.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create Your First Campaign

Use the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + P) and select **"Insert Campaign Template"**. This creates:

```markdown
---
type: solo_campaign
ruleset: Your System
genre: Fantasy
created: 2025-12-31
last_update: 2025-12-31
---

# Campaign Title

Campaign description...

## Session 1
*Date: 2025-12-31 | Duration: 2h*

### S1 *Opening scene*

```
Your adventure begins...
```
```

### 2. Write Your First Scene

All notation goes inside code blocks (triple backticks). Outside the code blocks, write your narrative:

````markdown
### S1 *Dark alley, midnight*

```
> Sneak past the guards
d: Stealth d6=4 vs TN 5 => Fail
=> My foot kicks a barrel. [E:AlertClock 1/6]

? Do they see me?
-> No, but... (d6=3)
=> They're suspicious. [N:Guard|watchful]
```

The guard's torch sweeps across the alley. I press myself against the wall.

```
> Wait for them to pass
tbl: d100=42 => "A distant scream distracts them"
=> Perfect timing. [Thread:Investigation|Open]
```
````

### 3. Open the Views

Click the dice icon (🎲) in the left sidebar to open the Campaign Dashboard, or use the command palette to open any view.

### Meta Notes

Meta notes are out-of-character observations that don't appear in References:

```
(note: Remember the shopkeeper's hint)
(reflection: This scene dragged, need more action)
(house rule: Using advantage on group checks)
(reminder: Follow up on the missing sword)
(question: Did I mark XP for this session?)
```

## Views Guide

### Campaign Dashboard

## Configuration

Open **Settings → Solo TTRPG Notation** to configure:

### General
- Enable/disable automatic indexing
- Control when files are parsed

### Templates
- Use default templates or specify custom template files
- Customize campaign, session, and scene templates

### Display
- Choose progress bar style (bars, circles, or segments)
- Set theme (auto, light, or dark)

### Advanced
- Enable debug mode for troubleshooting
- View index statistics
- Force reindex all campaigns

## Tips & Best practices

### Organization

**One campaign per file** - Each campaign file should contain all sessions for that campaign.

**Consistent session numbering** - Use `## Session 1`, `## Session 2`, etc. (the plugin looks for this format).

**Scene IDs** - Use `### S1`, `### S2`, etc. for simple scenes, or `### S1a`, `### T2-S3` for more complex tracking.

### Notation

**Code blocks are required** - All notation MUST be inside triple backtick code blocks. Narrative text goes outside.

**First mention vs references** - Use `[N:Name]` when first introducing an NPC, then `[#N:Name]` for later mentions.

**Tags are optional** - `[N:Bob]` and `[N:Bob|merchant|friendly]` both work. Tags help you remember context.

**Update trackers** - When a clock advances, write a new line: `[Clock:Alert 2/6]`. The plugin tracks the latest value.

### Workflow

1. **Start each session** with the session template (date and duration)
2. **Write notation in code blocks** as you play
3. **Add narrative** outside code blocks after the scene
4. **Review the dashboard** to see campaign statistics
5. **Use the Tag Browser** to remember NPCs and locations
6. **Check Progress Tracker** to see active clocks and tracks

## Troubleshooting

### Elements not appearing in views?

- Make sure notation is inside code blocks (```)
- Check that session headers use `## Session N` format
- Use **Reindex Current Campaign** command to refresh
- Enable debug mode in settings to see parsing errors

### Views not updating?

- The plugin parses files on load and when modified
- Use the refresh button (↻) in any view
- Try **Reindex All Campaigns** from command palette

### Performance issues with large vaults?

- Disable automatic indexing in settings
- Manually index campaigns when needed
- Use the file explorer to isolate campaign files
